# Cybersecurity Journey 🧠🛡️💻

## Who I Am
I am Jimmy. I am a 30-year-old server with no degree and no coding background, starting from scratch to become a highly-paid cybersecurity professional (goal: $150K+ salary).

## Why This Repo Exists
This will be my daily log, notes, scripts, and reflections as I move through learning cybersecurity. I am tired of the norm. I need to be able to live the life I dream of.

## Progress
- ✅ Day 1: Setup complete
- 🔜 Day 2: Networking and first TryHackMe lab
